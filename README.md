# QBNB
 Web application that is a clone of Airbnb

This was a school assignment where I was placed in a group of 4 so we can learn the SCRUM development model as well as other useful technologies such as python flask and web development skills.

Front end was made with HTML and CSS
Backend was made with Python Flask
Was hosted on Docker
